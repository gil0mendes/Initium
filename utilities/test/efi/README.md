This is a build of OVMF revision 14854, taken from the OpenSUSE binary package:

    https://build.opensuse.org/package/binaries/Virtualization/OVMF?repository=openSUSE_13.1

The official prebuilt versions of OVMF are outdated and do not work on newer
versions of QEMU, hence why this build was used instead.
